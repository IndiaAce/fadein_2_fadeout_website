      <h5>Where Is This Even Going?</h5>
      <h5><i>By Twich Collins | October 8, 2022</i></h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image coming soon lol this is how the pros develop a website, right?</div>
      <p><b>There is a specific reason why we gave this site its name...</b></p>
      <p>It’s one of the best pieces of advice any struggling or professional writer can get. It also happens to be the number one job any screenwriter has. It’s the first and last thing on the to-do list when completing a screenplay. That is because it literally means that in our world. FADE IN: is the first thing you type, and FADE OUT. is the last thing you type.</p>
      <p>Your job is to get from FADE IN: to FADE OUT. Simply put, get the writing done. Is it simple to do? Hell, no! I have been writing professionally for over a decade and still have to get reminded of this. We, as writers, tend to second-guess ourselves all the time. We end up pausing in the middle of writing, thinking what we just wrote is better for toilet paper than something projected on the silver screen. </p>
      <p>But here is the beauty of this phrase and screenwriting in general. It doesn’t matter what the first draft ends up being. It’s going to be crap, and that is okay. No first draft is perfect, no matter how cocky the person who wrote it is. It will be filled with imperfections like any other first draft. Hell, this is like the 4th draft of this article.</p>
      <p>Just because the first draft won’t be perfect doesn’t mean you should stop writing until you figure out how to fix the problem. That’s because you won’t get a full view of the problems until you get to FADE OUT. Once you can see the problems from a holistic standpoint, it will be easier to go back and solve the smaller ones. This can only be done once you have a first draft. In writing, it’s all about the rewrites. That’s where the problems get solved. The first draft is about finding the problems. Everything done after that draft is fixing those problems.</p>
      <p>So when you get to that point in your story where you are stuck, second-guessing, or feel you have lost the way, I suggest doing everything you can to push forward and get from FADE IN: to FADE OUT.</p>

      <p>I believe that everyone has it in them to tell a compelling and moving story. Be it a personal story about authentic experiences you have gone through or ones where everything is a fantasy, and the characters bear no resemblance to you or others you know. </p>
